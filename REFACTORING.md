# mcp-client-server Refactoring

This package has been refactored to enforce the 250-line limit requirement for all code files. The refactoring follows established patterns from other refactored packages.

## Directory Structure

The code has been reorganized into a more logical directory structure:

```
src/
  ├── common/           # Common utilities (errors, logger, version)
  ├── operations/       # Primary operations
  │   ├── client/       # Client operations
  │   │   ├── cache.ts  # Client caching
  │   │   ├── connection.ts  # Client connection management
  │   │   ├── index.ts  # Barrel exports
  │   │   ├── tests.ts  # Test execution
  │   │   ├── tools.ts  # Tool operations
  │   │   └── transport.ts  # Process transport
  │   └── docker/       # Docker operations
  │       ├── container.ts  # Container management
  │       ├── deploy.ts  # Deployment functions
  │       ├── index.ts  # Barrel exports
  │       ├── logs.ts  # Log handling
  │       └── process.ts  # Process management
  ├── server/           # Server setup
  │   └── setup.ts  # Server initialization
  ├── tools/            # MCP tool definitions
  │   ├── definitions.ts  # Tool schemas
  │   └── handlers.ts  # Tool request handlers
  ├── types/            # Type definitions
  │   └── schemas.ts  # Zod schemas
  └── index.ts          # Entry point
```

## Refactoring Pattern

The refactoring follows these principles:

1. **Functional Separation**: Code is split by logical functionality.
2. **Categorical Organization**: Related functions are grouped into dedicated directories.
3. **Barrel Exports**: Index files are used to maintain clean, backward-compatible APIs.
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each file focuses on a specific logical unit of functionality.

## Changes Made

### Previous Structure

Originally, the codebase had three files exceeding the 250-line limit:

1. `src/index.ts` - 289 lines
2. `src/operations/docker.ts` - 377 lines
3. `src/operations/mcp-client.ts` - 521 lines

### New Structure

1. **src/index.ts**: Simplified to import and start the server.

2. **Server Setup**:
   - `src/server/setup.ts`: Handles server creation, initialization, and request handler setup.

3. **Tool Definitions and Handlers**:
   - `src/tools/definitions.ts`: Contains tool definitions and schemas.
   - `src/tools/handlers.ts`: Handles tool requests and routes them to the appropriate operations.

4. **Docker Operations**: Split into multiple modules:
   - `src/operations/docker/process.ts`: Server process management.
   - `src/operations/docker/logs.ts`: Log handling functions.
   - `src/operations/docker/deploy.ts`: Deployment functionality.
   - `src/operations/docker/container.ts`: Container management.
   - `src/operations/docker/index.ts`: Barrel exports for backward compatibility.

5. **Client Operations**: Split into multiple modules:
   - `src/operations/client/cache.ts`: Client caching.
   - `src/operations/client/transport.ts`: Process transport implementation.
   - `src/operations/client/connection.ts`: Client connection management.
   - `src/operations/client/tools.ts`: Tool execution.
   - `src/operations/client/tests.ts`: Test execution.
   - `src/operations/client/index.ts`: Barrel exports for backward compatibility.

## Improvement Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each file is now smaller and more focused, making the code easier to understand and modify.
2. **Reusability**: Functionality is better isolated, allowing for easier code reuse.
3. **Testability**: Smaller, more focused modules are easier to test individually.
4. **Scalability**: The structure can accommodate future growth without requiring more large refactorings.
5. **Readability**: Smaller files with dedicated responsibilities improve code readability.

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding automated tests to validate the behavior of each component.
- Add more extensive documentation for each component.
- Consider further separating the server/client concerns.
